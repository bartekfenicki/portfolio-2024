    I am a Polish student currently studying the Multimedia Design 
  course in the Business Academy Southwest located in Esbjerg, 
  Denmark. I have always loved taking pictures and recording videos 
  but recently I discovered my new passion for creating different 
  types of digital work such as graphical and coding elements. Feel 
  free to explore and enjoy some of my projects alongside with my 
  private photo gallery!
